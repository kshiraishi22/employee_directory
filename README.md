# Employee Directory

# About
This application allows an employee and/or a manager to access information about a particular employee in the company through a simple search.

# How To
In order to use this application, the user must first install the necessary npm dependencies. Once they access the main employee directory, they will have access to all of the employees (500) and all of their information (name, phone number, email address, date of birth and their thumbnail). If a user is interested in looking up a specific employee, they can use the search bar and start typing in the desired employee's first name, last name, phone number, email address or date of birth. With every letter or number that they input, the app will only display employees that match that information, leading the user to the desired search outcome.
